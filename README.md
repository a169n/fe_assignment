# Intelligent Learning Twin Workspace

A minimal React single-page app demonstrating Context, `useReducer`, custom hooks, and persistence for a digital-twin themed project board. State is shared through a context provider and persisted to `localStorage`; UI filters and selection leverage a lightweight Zustand store. Styling uses inline, shadcn-inspired primitives without Tailwind or external stylesheets.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` – start Vite in development mode.
- `npm run build` – generate the production build.
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally.
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint checks.
- `npm run format` – format the repository with Prettier.
- `npm run format:check` – verify formatting without writing changes.
